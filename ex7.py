print("Mary had a little lamb.") # Prints a string
print("It's fleece was white as {}.".format("snow")) # Calls format on string in print function. This works the same as the previous exercise.

print("And everywhere that Mary went.") # Prints a string
print("." * 10) # Prints the string times 10

end1 = "C" # Sets variable to different strings
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

print(end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6, end = ' ') # Prints concatinated strings then adds a space to the end. The end variable didn't exist so it must be special. The comma denotes a new part or expression in the print function.
print(end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12) # Concatinates the rest of the end variables.
